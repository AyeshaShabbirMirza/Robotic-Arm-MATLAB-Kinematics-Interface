# Robotic Arm & MATLAB Kinematics Interface

**Course:** [Intro to Robotics, FJWU, Spring 2025]

## 📖 Project Overview
We designed and implemented a MATLAB-based graphical interface to control a 4-DOF robotic arm via forward and inverse kinematics. Users can input end-effector targets, visualize the arm’s motion, and generate trajectories.

## 📝 My Role
As **Group Lead**, I coordinated requirements gathering, oversaw interface design, wrote core kinematics modules, and led final integration and testing.
